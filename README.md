Recently started learning SQL from this course and it is AMAZING!
Unfortunately it does not offer a well known SQL interface like MySQL or Oracle, BUT with one interface learned, it's pretty easy to pick up other ones after about half an hour of playing around. At least that's how I felt transitioning from HeidiSQL to MySQL Workbench.
The important stuff is the actual SQL queries for now, for beginners like me.
