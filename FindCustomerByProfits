#SUM(); what customer has paid us the most money

#Could easily use 1 instead of p.customer_id in Group by,
#because it is the 1st in SELECT,
#Similar to how Order by is uses as well, in this case
#desc was added, because we want the highest sum at the top.

SELECT
	p.customer_id, 
	SUM(p.amount)
FROM
	payment p
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
